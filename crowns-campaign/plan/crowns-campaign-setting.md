# Crowns Campaign Setting

## Wilderness
The tiles in the 4 cardinal directions (N-E-S-W) are defined as follows:

- **North:** Mountain foothills... Scattered with caves into the mountain
- **East:** A dense forest... Infested with invasive mushrooms
- **South:** A murky, wet quagmire... Mostly navigated by small river boats
- **West:** A winding coastline... With hidden smuggler’s dens throughout

The 4 tiles in the diagonal directions (NE-SE-SW-NW) are defined as follows:
- **North-East:** Mountain foothills that gradually blend into a dense natural forest
- **South-East:** A dense forest that slowly transforms into a murky, wet quagmire
- **South-West:** A wet quagmire that meets a winding coastline in a fertile delta
- **North-West:** A winding coastline scatted with cliffside caves and steep bluffs

## Settlements
### Gold Hunter's Den (Starting Refuge)
### Ruined Castle in Northern Mountains (Landmark)
### Isolated Lumbermill in Eastern Forest (Manor)
### Old Docks, Small in Southern Quagmire (Landmark)
### Old Docks, Large in Western Coastline (Landmark)

## Factions
### The "Frank Herbert's *Dune*" Method
Dune has:
- House Atreides & House Harkonnen 
- The Bene Gesserit
- The Fremen
- The Padishah Emperor
- The Spacing Guild

So you need:
- Two noble houses with a long-standing hatred of each other that will inevitably erupt into violence
- A religion that masks its political power in the guise of spiritual guidance
- An unaligned tribal military force that exists outside the structure defining the other factions
- A distant ruler with a powerful military force that defends traditional power structures
- A mercantile force that masks its political power in the guise of pure economics

> Notice that each of these groupings represents an approach to political power: the power of an aristocratic title, of religion, of the nomad, of the military, and of the economy. Create factions that represent these groupings of political power, make them compete for a limited resource (the enhancement drug called spice for Dune), and let the sparks fly.
