## d6 plot hook gen

I made a little random generator (Generic but not dispersive with no low-sense words).

I found it great to set my character in a situation, giving him a personality, a hook quest and a personal quest, and the possibility to make NPCs on the go with their own goals and maybe a desired mcguffin.

You may compose a **short series of phrases** in sequence starting as the following, keep rolling to have more details and informations.

An example with actual rolls for this post:

>*I am a* \[ Gender \] \[2d6 NPC\]. *My main quest is to* \[ACTION+THEME\] *so i can* \[ACTION+THEME\] *and get* \[2d6 REWARD\]. *But* \[2d6 NPC\] *asked me to* \[ACTION+THEME\] in order to \[ACTION+THEME\], *he/she promised me* \[REWARD1+REWARD2\].

**Translated is:**

>*I am a* **\[male\] \[mysterious - accademic**\]*. My main quest is to* **\[Stop+A Place\]** *so i can* **\[Explore + Powers\]** *and get* **\[Precious+Help\]***.But* **\[Wild+Noble\]** *asked me to* **\[Retrieve/Take + Someone\*\]** *in order to* ***\[Free+Power\]***. Mysterious+Accademic *promised me* **\[Unmaterial+Weapon\]***.*  
>  
>\*This **Someone** is a **\[Female\]** **\[Common+Noble\]** who **\[Take+Something\]** to **\[Free + A place\]**.

You can roll *goals*, *npcs*, *objects*, *quests*, *places, next-moves, sometimes random events and loots*.

Of course it lack in something but: i love/need minimal stuff and combinations can suggest different things: objects becomes artifacts or weapons, mysterious stranger becomes undead or thief, depending on your setting and mood. Reroll if some results doesn't make sense to you (Some are easier to interpret than other)

Hope you like it r/Solo_Roleplaying â™¥ It's really easy, i have this written on a a6 notebook page :P
