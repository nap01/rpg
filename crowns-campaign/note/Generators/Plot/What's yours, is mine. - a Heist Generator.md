 "What's yours, is mine." - a Heist Generator


          There's nothing quite like a caper. While the idea of assembling an Ocean's Eleven style crew to perform a heist is largely a product of the modern era (one of the earlier examples being the Ransom of the Red Chief), there are remarkable similarities between caper flicks and the typical adventurer's band. You have the Smart One, the Muscle, the Skill Specialist, and the Vamp. All that really changes for adventurers is that they usually don't plan just one or two scores over a career, they plan dozens.



          To use this table, simply roll 4d8 and consult the results below. Unlike most of my other tables, Referees are encouraged to roll multiple times on both the third and fourth columns of this generator, to better reflect the numerous plot twists and set backs of your typical heist.
