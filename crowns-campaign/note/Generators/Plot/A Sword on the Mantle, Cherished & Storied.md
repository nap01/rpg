 A Sword on the Mantle, Cherished & Storied

"If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there" - Anton Chekhov


          Weapons have a mystique in society for obvious reasons. They're a lever by which one can exert their will on others. That mystique is reflected in the legends surrounding many real life mythological weapons; Sharur can fly and communicate with it's wielder, Tyrfing never misses a strike but always kills when unsheathed, Gae Bulg has seven heads with seven bars a head. The weapons are characters in the story themselves, not simply a statistical bonus meant to represent an enchantment. To move to fiction, one of the best moments in The Hobbit was when Gandalf just randomly finds Glamdring in a cave, only to be told later in Fellowship by Elrond that he'd found an ancient elven king's sword.

          This generator seeks to give you interesting weapons to use as macguffins, equipment for characters, or simply interesting flavor to sprinkle around the world. To use the generator simply roll 4d8 (or however many tables underneath you wish to use) and consult the results.
