Hunting Down the Wolves - a Bounty Target Generator 


￼


     Justice isn't blind--justice is greedy. She wishes to see the guilty dragged before her, to mutely witness them pay for their transgressions. Or, at least that's what the people responsible for hunting down these supposedly guilty men and women tell themselves. Even in societies that have well-developed systems of justice still have need for those willing to hunt down those that society (or merely the mob) has condemned. These hunters generally exist on the edges of society, considered barely better than those they pursue.


     This set of tables seeks to give you a resource for generating bounties and bounty targets for use in your games. To use this generator, simply roll 4d8 and consult the relevant tables below.

￼


d8

How much is the bounty worth?

1

A pittance, barely worth getting on the trail for.

2-3

Enough to be worth one's time, but also enough to bring a rival onto the scene.

4-5

A tidy amount, enough to finance months of decent living. There are probably two or three other hunters looking to find them as well

6-7

A huge score. While not enough to retire, it would be a massive boon. There will be quite a lot of competitors, perhaps five or six.

8

A king's ransom, probably financed by an organization, rather than an individual. A dozen or more rivals will undoubtedly be after it as well.


￼

What did the fugitive do?

1

Murder.

3

Heresy.

Oath-breaking.

Smuggling.

Kidnapping.

Roll twice, ignoring this result if it comes up again. The fugitive committed a combination of these crimes.
