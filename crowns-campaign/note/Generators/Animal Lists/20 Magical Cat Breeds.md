 20 Magical Cat Breeds


Who doesn't love cats? Seriously, if you don't like cats you need to question some life decisions - though obviously not the decision to read this blog. Regardless, much like the question posed by my article on magical dog breeds, why would a fantasy setting not have it's own versions of cats? They're absolutely ubiquitous as pets in most cultures on our planet. Why would Athas, Faerun or Thedas be any different? So, in that vein I present twenty species of various felines for use in your home setting. Any names sourced from locations are from my own homebrew setting.

Description
1
	
Biamese
	
These graceful, sleek cats range from tan to dark brown and are always born in pairs. Biamese are mentally linked to their twins, and they can act together in perfect synchronous movements. Biamese gain advantage on any roll that their twin is also engaged in.

Altrian Rain Coon
	
Bred from captured cloud elementals and particularly robust felines, Rain Coons are used in small groups to call down precipitation on targeted areas. These fluffy, long-haired cats are temperamental, and will only call rain if properly appeased. Altrians can call rain for 1d4 hours over a 30ft radius 1/day.

Kaidan Hex Cat
	
Associated with witches and necromancers, kaidan are sinister creatures with an intelligence that outstrips other cats. Hex cats are almost always solid colors such as black or white. They sometimes have multiple tails and they can walk upright and speak the language of their owners.
4
	
Propheceline
	
Descended from felines that were used to keep rodents out of temples and shrines, Prophecelines are small and quiet creatures that come in a variety of coats. They have the uncanny ability to show up before events of great import. As a result priests now use them as a source of divination, and they gain advantage in the ceremony when assisted by one of these animals.

Liorian Whorlcat
	
Perhaps the angriest animal to live within the Rainwood, the Whorlcat is considered an ill omen by the tribes of the forest. Large and covered in tawny to orange fur, whorlcats have the bizarre ability to spin themselves on the tops of their tails quickly enough to turn into a blur of claws and teeth. Whorlcats can use this spinning ability 3/day. Whorlcats can move 20ft/turn while spinning, and automatically attack anything in their path while moving at a +1 bonus, with 1d4 for damage.

Cernunnokian Spire Cat
	
Theorized by sages to be the result of house cats interbreeding with underdark creatures. Spire cats are sleek, hairless creatures with eyes that glow brightly when hit with any sort of light. Spire Cats can climb on vertical surfaces as if they were on the ground.
7
	
Abyssinian Pard
	
Huge and aggressive, these cats are the size of a large dog possessing thick coats covered in spots. Pards are used as show pieces and guardians for members of the elite; the poor wretches who take care of these felines suffer from a high turn-over rate. Pards have an additional hit die than a typical cat, and they are an additional size category larger.

Kashan Dream Eater
	
Wane and slender in appearance, these odd animals were developed by oneiromancers to protect them while they were sleeping. Kashans survive on dreams instead of normal food, and their presence can blunt the effects of mental attacks. A presence of a Kashan while a character is sleeping can negate the effects of a single spell or attack meant to affect their dreams.
9
	
Dorician Yowler
	
A particularly strange breed, the Yowler is mostly average in appearance. It is however, extremely loud, enough so that its screeches can disrupt spellcasting. Trained Yowlers are often used by nobles or inquisitors to ensure that they cannot be beguiled. Yowlers force a concentration check for spellcasting to any who hear while they scream. Yowlers can scream 3/day.
10
	
Charantian Shorthair
	
A favorite of elves and other forest dwellers, the Charantian is a mild-mannered and friendly breed. While it's lineage is unclear, the Charantian has the ability to slowly shift the color of it's coat to be in line with that of its surroundings.
11
	
Serradian Phantom Cat
	
The bane of fishmongers and the darling of thieves the world over, the Serradian is a haughty and large breed prone to corpulence. Long of coat and tending towards darker colors, the Serradian has the ability stutter itself through non-metal objects, most notably walls.
12
	
Prismatic Tabby
	
Likely the result of some mad mage's experiments (but honestly, what isn't?) the Prismatic tabby is a small, stocky cat with an iridescent, rainbow-hued coat. When frightened or agitated, the tabby can surge arcane energy in the environment through it's fur to blind nearby on-lookers. This ability can be used 2/day and has the same effects as the Color Spray spell as cast by a 1st level magic-user.
13
	
Hoaridga's Liebling
	
Known to be quite rare, the Liebling hails from an isolated monastic community in the far north. Used as training aids for budding mystics, Lieblings have the ability to give off psychic chatter to those who have the ability to hear it. This chatter makes telepathic communication effectively impossible in the presence of one of these animals.
14
	
Chardonian Levkoy
	
A breed of working cats, Levkoys are small, quick felines with short, velvet like coats that come in a variety of earth tones. Levkoys not only love water, they are fully amphibious. Many find their use by seafarers to keep their ships clear of vermin.
15
	
Selkirk Beguiler
	
Beloved by crooked merchants and con-artists, the Selkirk Beguiler is reputedly the result of a wish to a genie. Whatever their origin, the breed is truly gorgeous, with long, silky fur and coats ranging from vivid blues to deep purples. Most striking are their eyes, which seem depthless and can entrance those who stare into them for too long. Stupified victims are easily robbed.
16
	
Nine-lived Drow Cat.
	
The product of centuries of magical research by the dwellers below, the Nine-lived Drow Cat is named for it's ability to come back to life from the dead. Fine-boned and always black of coat, these strange cats can knit themselves back from anything short of a Disintegrate spell.
17
	
Corantinian Dingmaul
	
Supposedly native to the Corantine heartland, the Dingmaul is a large, tree-dwelling cat with a bulbous, mace-like mass of bone at the end of their tails. Commonly mottled or calico, Dingmauls are known for their propensity to knock unaware travelers out and eat their rations.
18
	
Zelazian Spikefur
	
Native to the deserts surrounding Doru, the Spikefur is named for the hair-like thorns extending from their bodies instead of a normal coat. These spines allow the feline to attack and maul creatures far larger than it and they are fearless as a result. Zelazian spikes make for fine daggers.
19
	
Teacup Lion
	
Sourced from a single mating pair designed as a gift to their monarch by a courtly wizard, Teacup lions have found their place as lap warmers and diversions for the idle rich. Befitting their names, teacup lions are for all appearances nothing more than normal lions the size of housecats. They are also unfortunately the same as normal lions in temperament.

Soucian Flying Cat
	
Something of a marketing gimmick, the Soucian Flying Cat cannot truly fly, however it can hover up to several feet off of the ground. This has made the breed popular for use in carnivals or other cheap roadside diversions.
