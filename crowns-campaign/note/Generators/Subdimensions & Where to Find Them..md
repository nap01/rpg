 Subdimensions & Where to Find Them.

The multiverse is filled with extra dimensional spaces, pocket planes, temporal knots and astral prisons. It is as if reality itself is porous and blurred, with the surrounding spheres of existence constantly trying to invade the prime material. These numerous spaces have sprung into being by various means, whether through the power of the arcane or divine, or simply through strange quirks of circumstance. For every time capsule or treasure room, there is an oubliette containing some mind-bending horror or cursed artifact. Those who probe these places do so at their own peril.

GMs who wish to throw one of these place together on the fly can simply roll 6d8, then d4s for each of the sub-results - the size table does not have sub-results. Please note that some of these combinations are quite dire, or nearly impossible to escape without some sort of telegraphing on the GM's part.
