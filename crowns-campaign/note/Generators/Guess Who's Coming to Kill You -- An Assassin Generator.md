"'Cause at the end of the day, as long as there's two people left alive on the planet, someone is going to want someone dead." - The Sniper, Team Fortress 2


        There's always a need for lurking threats in any game. Players tend to step on a lot of toes and make a lot of enemies in the process. Some will undoubtedly wish to hunt them down and try to kill them on their own, or hire others to do the job for them. While their methods may have broadened due to being in a fantasy setting, there's still not ever a shortage of people willing to murder others for a petty reason or a paycheck.

To use this generator, simply roll 4d8 and consult the tables below. As usual, I have tried to do my best to keep these tables as general as possible in order to support the broadest amount of setting I could.


d8
	

What did the PCs do?

1
	

Wrong place, wrong time. They saw something they shouldn't have.

2
	

Nothing. They are being targeted for kicks.

3
	

The survivors or victims of wrongdoing on their part are getting even.

4
	

Spoke up about some hot button issue and offended some local elite.

5-6
	

Stood in the way of someone enriching themselves.

7
	

Became the subjects of some prophecy. Their deaths will supposedly stop or fulfill it.

8
	

This is a case of mistaken identity. Roll again, ignoring this result. The second roll represents reason for the target's death.

What's the killer like?

1
	

A consummate professional. Methodical, deadly, and fully embracing dirty tactics.

2
	

Barely restrained in their rage. They favor brutal ambushes and attempt to spread terror.

3
	

Doubting their course in life. While skilled, their heart isn't in it anymore.

4
	

Seemingly incompetent or harmless. They use this to catch their targets off-guard.

5
	

A butcher. Violence isn't just a tool, it is pleasurable or amusing to them.

6
	

Dead-eyed. There is nothing here. Just a vehicle for dealing death.

7
	

Fanatical. They kill for a higher cause, real or imagined.

8
	

Cheerfully amoral. It is as if this is all a sort of sick game to them.


d8
	

How do they carry out their killings?

1-4
	

Old-fashioned violence, whether that be conventional or magical.

5
	

Poison, disease, or other indirect methods.

6
	

Summoned or enslaved creatures.

7
	

Traps, in the form of mechanical devices, or "accidents" using the environment.

8
	

Curses, hexes, or other dire enchantments that cause bad luck.


d8
	

What is unique about them?

1
	

They hail from a distant or distinct culture and are more obvious as a result.

2
	

Whether simply proud, or unable to stop themselves, they leave calling cards behind.

3
	

The killer is an undead, or some other unholy creature.

4
	

Their reputation precedes them. The PCs may find it more difficult to find aid.

5
	

There isn't only one assassin, but rather a small group.

6
	

Some mystical ritual or enchantment binds the killer to the PCs. They know where they are.

7
	

The assassin has bribed locals to quietly observe and report the PCs comings and goings.

8
	

An oath has been sworn. The killer cannot break it and must be relentless.
