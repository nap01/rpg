# 3.1 - Culture
*And what of the people there?*

A wild and dizzying array of cultures can exist in any fantasy setting, from savage nomadic tribes, to learned and cultivated scholars. Existing side by side and contending with one another with concerns and forces that we ourselves never had to adapt to, their solutions and ways of living can be as strange as our imaginations allow; governance by the ghosts of their ancestors, living atop the backs of great stag beetles, under the yoke of a dragon, the possibilities are endless. These groups war, intermix and render themselves anew.

The fifth in my series on rolling up a community through tables, this entry focuses on the overall structure of the polity itself, how it conducts itself, what it values and how they interact with the world around them. It can be difficult to craft fantasy societies without resorting to either stereotyping or riffing off of real world cultures. My solution to this was to mix the overall qualities until the end result is more than simply 'Germans/French/English...but' by dint of their random nature. I specifically did not mention any kind of humanoid, such a Dwarf, Elf, etc. as to keep these tables as setting neutral as possible.

To use this table, roll 4d8 and then resolve and further results with 1d4s.
