# Beasts, Hungry for Blood & Coin

From steely-eyed killers seizing their destinies at the end of a blade, to desperate folk looking for coin to feed their hungry families, there have always been those who are willing to fight not for the defense of their homes or homelands, but for their own financial gain. They range far and wide, looking to throw themselves into situations which sensible folk have to be tricked into using honeyed lies like honor or glory. Their skills and methods are as varied as their motives, but their desire for payment unites them all.


The eighth in my series on how to roll up the various aspects of a settlement primarily through tables, this post covers warriors for hire, whatever form that may take. As always, I've done my best to largely divorce the tables from specific setting elements outside of a generalized fantasy setting. To use this generator, simply roll 4d8 and consult the results.

What kind of warriors are these?
1
	
Light Infantry, trained to do battle loose-order and to fight as raiders, scouts and skirmishers. They are equipped with a mix of ranged and melee weapons.
2
	
Heavy Infantry, troops meant to fight in pitched battle and in line, these folk are equipped with the heaviest weapons and armor that they can afford.
3
	
Light Cavalry possessed of fleets mounts and raged weapons. These troops are talented marauders and scouts and will eagerly run down any retreating enemies.
4
	
Heavy Cavalry, meant to shatter the enemy with brutal charges. These mounted warriors are heavily armed and armored, with mounts large and powerful enough to carry them.
5
	
A siege train, which includes transports, specialists and ammunition. These could take the form of cannon, rams, sappers or even stranger things.
6
	
Ranged troops, whether they are equipped with bows, crossbows or firearms, these soldiers will do their best to stay far away from the enemy and pepper them with missiles.
7
	
Privateers, using whatever kind of vessel is appropriate for the setting. Most commonly this means a sea-going ship, but this could also mean a river vessel or even something more exotic like an airship.
8
	
A mixed force, roll twice on this table (ignoring this result if it comes up again) to determine what kind of soldiers make up this varied unit.

How numerous are they?
1
	
A small handful, perhaps just a dozen
2
	
Several squads, comprising a couple of units and several dozen troops.
3
	
A company, including several officers, which number a little over a hundred in total.
4-5
	
A cohort, hundreds of battle-ready soldiers and their attendant camp followers.
6-7
	
A brigade or legion, several thousand soldiers, along with their support staff, commanders and wagon train.
8
	
A veritable army, comprising ~20-30,000 soldiers, along with command staff and various support troops.

Who leads them?
1
	
A noble, fallen from glory and perhaps even exiled from the land of their birth. Their leader is likely skilled at both battle and diplomacy, but they are consumed by bitterness from their state and will likely do nearly anything to rectify it.
2
	
These troops mutinied against their officers, and are commanded by the former ringleaders. the ringleaders have grouped themselves into a council, and will vote on important decisions. Discipline and uniformity is likely lax.
3
	
A soldier's soldier, someone who has fought their way through countless campaigns and has risen to a position of command. They are likely skilled in the arts of war and death, but lack tact.
4
	
A member of the nobility in good standing. Their troops are likely drawn from lands the noble's family controls. The Noble isn't likely a mere adventurer, they are looking to advantage their family or themselves.
5
	
These are mercenaries in name only, they are barely better than bandits in behavior and their leader is no exception. Likely a vicious killer themselves, the commander of this band keeps control through violence and bribery.
6
	
Founded as a money-making endeavor, the commander of this group is more akin to a merchant than a warrior. The leader is likely skilled at negotiating contracts and sniffing out profitable battles.
7
	
Led by a devout worshipper of a deity, the troops have been enticed or forced into the worship of their commander's god. Whether or not their devotion is true, their leader's is, and they will use the miracles granted by their deity to help them in battle.
8
	
A spellcaster, known for their strange and often baffling ways, leads this group by dint of their abilities. They will aid their folk with spells and mystical knowledge.

How skilled are they? Are they loyal?
1
	
Rabble, hardly a cut above levies. They are cowards, who will run if the battle goes against them (-2 to all Morale checks), they are however extremely cheap (-40% to costs)
2
	
Decently trained and equipped, but they lack motivation (-1 to all Morale checks) and they have little care towards their own reputations. They will betray their employer if given a better offer.
3-5
	
Average pay for average skill. They have been trained to acceptable standards, but are nothing special beyond having a reputation for loyalty.
6
	
Well drilled and disciplined (+1 to all Morale checks) troops with an iron-shod reputation.
7
	
The elite, the cream of the crop (+2 to all Morale checks, +1 all Attack rolls). They are brave and unshakably loyal, but they are hideously expensive (+40% to costs)
8
	
Elite (+2 to all Morale checks, +1 all Attack rolls) soldiers who know all too well their own worth. They cost more (+20% to costs) but that coin does not win their loyalty. They fight for whoever pays them most, even switching sides in the midst of battle.
